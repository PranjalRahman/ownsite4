# ownsite4
Dated March 2016. This is my fourth website. I took a course on Udemy on designing a responsive webpage WITH Bootstrap. In contrast to ownsite3, this one requires you to understand new additional syntax rules, which may be daunting at first, but totally worth considering the amazing design that are possible.
